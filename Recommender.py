## IDEAS:
# the model algorithm is the same, but the occasion/weather can be treated as bias terms
# Bias can be thought of as multipliers that influence
# Can ask the user about "importance" factor, which can increase or decrease that multiplier
# As a apart of the initial screening phase, the user should be prompted to give initial preference data 
# (like favorite color or color combo or type of clothing) so the model can pretrain and give decent initial screening fits
